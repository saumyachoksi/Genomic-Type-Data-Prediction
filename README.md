# Genomic-Type-Data-Prediction

Genomic Type Data Prediction was a course project for Machine Learning at NJIT in Fall 2019. Here I have integrated ensemble learning, cross validation and feature selection techniques for classifying genomic data. For model training and predicting to increase model efficiency, reduced 29,623 total features to 20 features from scratch in Python without using ML libraries.
